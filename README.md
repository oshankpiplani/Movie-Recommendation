ðŸŽ¬ AI Movie Recommender - Simple Setup Guide

An AI-powered movie recommendation system that understands what you're looking for and suggests movies you'll love!

What Does This Do?
Instead of browsing through endless movie lists, just tell our AI what kind of movie you want:

"I want a funny romantic comedy"
"Show me scary movies with ghosts"
"Action movie with explosions"

The AI understands your request and finds the perfect movies for you!
